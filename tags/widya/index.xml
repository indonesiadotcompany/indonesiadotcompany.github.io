      <description>Formal education in indonesia (maybe mostly on this world) should be restructurized to get better result oriented based on unique student / unique human characteristic.
every human is have own unique characteristic that can be group to several pattern, like there are some student that good / interest in linguistic, there are good in math, there are good in physical things, there are good in business, etx.
Unfortunately the education in indonesia or maybe mostly in this world is designed to make a &#39;worker style&#39; people, worker in mean of people who work at office / building / industry, and that is not suit to some people who have talent in business, people who have talent in inventing something that will change the world better and or other people who hate job as a worker.</description>
